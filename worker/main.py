"""Worker process entry point.

Bootstraps logging + tracing, connects to NATS JetStream (which ensures this
service's streams exist), subscribes the durable consumers, and runs until
SIGINT/SIGTERM — then drains in-flight work and disposes resources cleanly.

This worker is IO-bound (database + broker), so there is no process pool: the
CPU-heavy part of generation happens in document-generation, not here.

Run locally:

    python -m worker.main
