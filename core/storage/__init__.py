"""Object storage facade.

Wraps an S3-compatible client (MinIO in dev/staging/production) behind a tiny
function-shaped API so callers in ``api/administrative_document/service.py``
don't need to know about aiobotocore directly.

Exposed surface:
- ``upload(key, content, content_type=None, bucket=None)`` — put_object
- ``download(key, bucket=None) -> bytes`` — get_object
- ``delete(key, bucket=None)`` — best-effort delete_object
- ``build_s3_uri(bucket, key)`` / ``parse_s3_uri(uri)`` — the ``file_ref`` form
- ``ObjectNotFound`` — raised by ``download`` when the key does not exist
- ``TransientStorageError`` — raised by ``download`` for retryable errors
