"""
Request limits middleware — body size cap + request timeout.

Protects against oversized payloads and slow-loris / hung-request attacks.

Body size check:
    Reads Content-Length before the request reaches FastAPI's body parser.
    If the declared length exceeds the per-route cap (see ``_max_body_for``),
    the request is rejected immediately with 413 Payload Too Large, before any
    body is read into memory.

    This is a cheap up-front gate, not a complete one. A client using chunked
    transfer-encoding sends no Content-Length and so slips past this check; the
    middleware cannot bound such a body without first buffering it, which would
    allocate the very memory the cap exists to prevent. The memory bound is
    therefore enforced again where the body is actually loaded: the document
    version upload handler reads the file in bounded chunks and rejects at
    UPLOAD_MAX_BODY_BYTES (see
    api/administrative_document/service.py::_read_within_cap).

Request timeout:
    Wraps the entire downstream handler in asyncio.wait_for().
    If the handler does not complete within TIMEOUT_SECONDS,
    the client receives a 504 Gateway Timeout.

Usage:
    app.add_middleware(RequestLimitsMiddleware)
